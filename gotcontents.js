		Intro:"House Stark of Winterfell is one of the Great Houses of Westeros and the principal noble house of the north. In days of old they ruled as Kings of Winter, but since Aegon's Conquest they have been Wardens of the North and ruled as Lords of Winterfell. Their seat,Winterfell, is an ancient castle renowned for its strength.Their sigil is a grey direwolf racing across a field of white. Their words are \"Winter is Coming\", one of only a few house mottoes to be a warning rather than a boast.[1] Several of the POV characters of A Song of Ice and Fire are members of House StarkAside from the Karstarks of Karhold, the Starks of Winterfell may have other, distant relatives in the north. White Harbor and Barrowton are considered to be likely options.[2] Some younger Starks have also held vassal holdfasts for the lords of Winterfell.[3]",
		Culture:{
			Traits:"The Starks have a reputation for long faces,[4][5] brown hair,[5] and grey eyes.[6][7] Some are known for melancholy[8] and iciness,[9] while others have a wildness sometimes called \"wolf blood\".[10][11][12]In the current generation of Starks, several members (e.g., Arya and Bran Stark and Jon Snow) have the ability to enter the minds of their direwolf pets as wargs, giving them the ability to experience the senses of their direwolves[13] and to see through their eyes. The latter occurs most frequently when the children sleep,[14][15] although they are able to do it at will when awake, once they are more practiced.[16][15]",
			Customs:"House Stark traditionally buries deceased members of their family in the crypts below Winterfell.[17][18] The Kings of Winter and Lords of Winterfell are given a statue of their likeness, sitting by their tomb, whereas other family members normally do not get one.[19] Exceptions include Brandon and Lyanna Stark, who were given statues by their brother, Lord Eddard Stark,[19] and Artos Stark. The statues of the kings and lords have stone wolves by their feet[20][18] and have swords placed upon their lap,[18] which are said to keep the spirits of the dead at rest, locked within their tombs.[21][17]House Stark traditionally follows the old gods.[22][23][24][25] Following the marriage of Eddard to Lady Catelyn Tully, a follower of the Faith of the Seven, a small sept was constructed at Winterfell.[26]The Starks have traditionally been friends of the Night's Watch.[19] The four youngest men to have served as Lord Commander, including Osric Stark, were brothers, sons, or bastards of Kings in the North.[27]"

		History:{
			"Kings in the North":"The Starks are an ancient house of First Men descent.[1] House Stark was founded by Brandon the Builder, a legendary figure who lived during the Age of Heroes. Bran the Builder is said to have raised Winterfell, the seat of the Starks, and the Wall,[28] and other legends connect him with Storm's End[29] and the Hightower.[30] The Starks were Kings of Winter in the north for eight thousand years[31][32] since the Age of Heroes, possibly beginning with Bran the Builder. The Night's King, the attainted thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, has been suggested to have been a Stark, among other possibilities.[33] The Night's King is said to have been defeated by Brandon the Breaker and Joramun.[34]The ancient Starks gradually defeated rival kings, such as the Barrow Kings to their south and the Red Kings to their east.[35] For several millennia, the Starks were not the uncontested Kings in the North. Their primary antagonists, the Red Kings from House Bolton of the Dreadfort, swore fealty some thousand years ago, ending their flaying ways. Meanwhile, King Jon Stark drove pirates from the White Knife, and the Wolf's Den was built at its mouth. This stronghold was often granted to sons and grandsons of the King in the North; one such branch, the Greystarks, was extinguished after allying with the Boltons against the Starks.[36] King Jon's son, Rickard, defeated the Marsh King and married his daughter, bringing the Neck into Winterfell's realm under the lordship of House Reed.[19]When Andals attempted to conquer the north, King Theon Stark made common cause with House Bolton and defeated Argos Sevenstar in the Battle of the Weeping Water, after which he raised a fleet and sailed to Andalos. There he took revenge by sacking and putting hundreds to death. He later conquered the Three Sisters, and battled against the ironborn, driving them away from Cape Kraken and Bear Island and slaying Ravos Hoare. Both places were later taken back by King Loron Greyjoy, and King Rodrik Stark took Bear Island back after Loron's death. It is said that he did so by winning a wrestling match, though some scholars doubt the truth of this tale.[37][19] Rodrik's sons and grandsons took back Cape Kraken.[35] King Theon also smashed a rebellion in the Rills, and gave aid to the Night's Watch against wildlings.[35]House Stark attempted to conquer the Three Sisters, which began a conflict between the Starks and House Arryn from the Vale. In response to the Rape of the Three Sisters, the Sistermen asked for help from Mathos II Arryn, King of Mountain and Vale. This conflict, the War Across the Water, lasted for a thousand years, during which time the Starks thrice landed on the Fingers.[38][39] During King Edric Stark's hundred-year long reign, the Wolf's Den, already torched by House Arryn, was captured by slavers from the Stepstones. Edric's great-grandson, King Brandon \"Ice Eyes\", took back the Wolf's Den.[36] After a thousand years of war, the Arryns were victorious over the Starks, and the Valemen have ruled over the Three Sisters ever since.[38]Several centuries before Aegon's Conquest,[N 1] House Manderly was driven into exile from the Mander by Lord Lorimar Peake during the reign of Perceon III Gardener, King of the Reach.[35] The Starks welcomed them to the north, and accepted oaths of fealthy from the Manderlys, giving them the Wolf's Den and the surrounding lands, leading to the creation of White Harbor around the Wolf's Den.[40][35][41]Possibly around 700 BC,[N 2] Karlon Stark, a younger son of Winterfell, helped crush a rebel lord. As a reward, he was granted lands on which he built a keep named Karl's Hold. Over time, the keep became known as Karhold and Karlon's descendants became House Karstark.[42]King Brandon the Shipwright attempted to sail across the Sunset Sea, but never returned back home. His son, also named Brandon, burned the northern fleet in his grief.[19] The north has had no fleet since.[43]The Starks helped repel several major wildling invasions, such as when they and their Umber bannermen defeated the brother Kings-Beyond-the-Wall Gendel and Gorne three thousand years ago.[44] Bael the Bard is said to have sired a son on the maiden daughter of Brandon the Daughterless. Bael was later slain by his own son, who was unaware of the fact that Bael was his father.[45]",
			"Targaryen Dynasty":"During Aegon's Conquest, King Torrhen Stark raised thirty thousand northmen and marched south. With the burning of Harrenhal and the Field of Fire in mind, however, Torrhen submitted without battle to Aegon I Targaryen.[46] Since the time of the King Who Knelt, the Starks have held the north for the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms as Wardens of the North.[47] Queen Rhaenys Targaryen arranged the marriage of Torrhen's daughter to Ronnel Arryn, the Lord of the Eyrie, in an attempt to knit the new realm together.[48][49] There are letters at the Citadel which suggest that Torrhen only agreed to this match after much protest, and that his sons had refused to attend the wedding.[48] Torrhen's sons did not agree with the rule of House Targaryen. Some spoke of rebelling and raising the Stark banner,[48] but it is unknown whether a rebellion took place.During the reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, Lord Stark[N 3] donated land, which was renamed the New Gift, to the Night's Watch. While in current times it is said that Lord Stark was glad to do so, he in truth had been forced to do so by King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and Queen Alysanne. Lord Stark's brother sent letters to the Citadel, asking for precedents against forced donation of property. As such, it was said at the time that the Starks were bitter about having been forced to part with the land, and Maester Yandel believes that this might have been the reason why Lord Ellard Stark supported the claim of Laenor Velaryon over the claim of Prince Viserys Targaryen during the Great Council of 101 AC.[48]In 129 AC, as the Dance of the Dragons began, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon recruited Lord Cregan Stark's aid for his mother, Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, known as the Pact of Ice and Fire,[48] even though the north was considered to be too remote to be of much influence in the war.[50] Cregan delayed giving aid, as he wished to have as many men as possible to harvest crops before winter came.[51] After winter had begun, Cregan led a great army of men, childless, homeless, unwed, or old men, and younger sons, to King's Landing. He arrived after King Aegon II Targaryen had been poisoned, however, and though he had hoped to punish those lords who had supported Aegon II, Lord Corlys Velaryon had already send out ravens suing for peace. While the court awaited replies, Cregan held sway and arrested all those involved in Aegon II's death. Young King Aegon III Targaryen was cowed into naming Cregan his Hand of the King, though Cregan served only a day in that office, a time known as the Hour of the Wolf. Lord Stark held trials for twenty-one out of twenty-two of his prisoners, with Corlys the only one spared a trial. Aegon III pardoned Lord Velaryon and restored his titles to him, which Cregan allowed when Aly Blackwood offered the Hand her own hand in marriage. Cregan returned north the next day.[52]Cregan's heir, Rickon, fought in the conquest of Dorne during the reign of King Daeron I Targaryen. He died during one of the final battles outside of Sunspear.[48] Lord Barthogan Stark, Cregan's younger son, died in the Skagosi rebellion during the reign of Daeron II Targaryen.[53] Early in the reign of Aerys I, Lord Beron Stark, Cregan's grandson, gathered swords to battle Lord Dagon Greyjoy.[54] He became fatally injured in battle, and as he slowly succumed of his wounds, his wife and several recent Stark widows struggled over the succession, as there were multiple potential heirs.[55][56]In 226 AC, Raymun Redbeard, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, led a wildling invasion. Lord Willam Stark of Winterfell and Lord Harmond Umber of Last Hearth met the wildling host in battle on the shores of Long Lake. Although Willam was killed by Raymun, his younger brother, Artos, avenged him by slaying the King-Beyond-the-Wall.",
			"Robert's Rebellion":"Lord Rickard Stark, urged on by his maester, Walys, allegedly sought to further southron alliances.[58] He sent his second son, Eddard, to be fostered with Lord Jon Arryn at the Eyrie at the age of eight. There, Eddard befriended fellow ward Robert Baratheon.[26][59] Rickard betrothed his heir, Brandon, to Catelyn Tully, the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun,[59] and his only daughter, Lyanna, to Robert, Lord of Storm's End.[8][60] Rickard's four children attended the tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC, where they met Howland Reed. After winning the jousting competition at the tourney, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen crowned Lyanna as his queen of love and beauty, passing over his own wife, Princess Elia Martell.[61]In 282 AC, Brandon Stark was at Riverrun when the date of his wedding to Catelyn Tully was announced. Petyr Baelish, Lord Hoster's ward, had been in love with Catelyn for years, and challenged Brandon to a duel for Catelyn's hand. Brandon won.[62][63][64][6] After the duel, Brandon left Riverrun, promising his bride-to-be that he would return soon.[6] On his way back to Riverrun, however, Brandon heard about Lyanna's abduction by Prince Rhaegar, and rode for King's Landing, where he was arrested by Aerys II for threatening the life of the crown prince. Rickard, who had been on his way to Riverrun with the wedding party, was summoned to court to answer for Brandon's crime. Brandon and Rickard were executed by Aerys II; Rickard was burned alive, while Brandon strangled himself in his attempt to rescue his father.[65][22][66] After the executions, King Aerys demanded the heads of Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon from their former foster father, Jon Arryn. The Lord of the Eyrie refused, however, and raised his banners in revolt.[26][67] This act is seen as the start of Robert's Rebellion.[67]Eddard travelled made an arduous journey through the Vale of Arryn and the Bite to call his banners in the north.[39] The new lord then marched south and won an important victory during the Battle of the Bells, rescuing his friend Robert.[68] Next, he went to Riverrun, where he honored his late brother Brandon's betrothal by marrying Catelyn Tully as part of an alliance to bring House Tully into the rebel fold.[69][59] One of the principal commanders in the war, Ned took command of the rebel army after the Battle of the Trident, following the remnants of Rhaegar's army to King's Landing.Ned arrived at the capital after the Sack of King's Landing by Lord Tywin Lannister, however, and Lord Stark found Aerys II dead and Ser Jaime Lannister sitting on the Iron Throne.[70] He had a falling out with Robert when Robert accepted the aid of House Lannister and condoned the murders of Rhaegar's wife, young daughter, and infant son. Eddard rode south the next day to relieve the siege of Storm's End.[70] Afterwards, Eddard and six companions went to retrieve Lyanna at the fortress Rhaegar had named the tower of joy.[71] They fought the three Kingsguard knights stationed there, who killed all but Eddard and Howland Reed.[71] Eddard found Lyanna dying in a bed of blood, clutching rose petals, dead and black, in her palm.[8] She forced him to make a promise to her, the contents of which are unknown, but which have haunted Eddard since. Eddard and Robert were reconciled in their shared grief over Lyanna's death.[70]Eddard returned from the war with his bastard son, Jon Snow,[59] said to have been birthed by Wylla,[70] and Ned was presented with his trueborn son, Robb, by Catelyn when she arrived from Riverrun. Ned buried Lyanna's body in the crypt of Winterfell beside her father and brother.[8] Eddard's younger brother, Benjen, joined the Night's Watch within a few months of Eddard's return from the war.[72] A skilled ranger,[73] Benjen eventually became First Ranger.[74] Eddard fought in Greyjoy's Rebellion in 289 AC, and took Balon Greyjoy's son Theon with him to Winterfell, a hostage to ensure the loyalty of the Lord of the Iron Islands.[8] Eddard has ruled the north in Robert's name, keeping a distance from the intrigue-ridden politics of King's Landing."

			"A Game of Thrones":"Following the death of his Hand of the King, Lord Jon Arryn, King Robert I Baratheon journeys to Winterfell to offer Lord Eddard Stark the office.[26][8] A letter arrives from Lysa Arryn, Jon's widow and Eddard's wife Catelyn's sister, who claims the Lannisters were behind Lord Arryn's sudden death. At Catelyn's urging, Ned grudgingly accepts the Handship and a betrothal of their daughter Sansa to Prince Joffrey Baratheon.[59] During the royal party's stay, Eddard's second son, Bran, accidentally witnesses Queen Cersei Lannister having sex with her twin brother, Ser Jaime.[75] Jaime throws Bran out of the tower window, hoping to kill him to keep their relationship a secret.[75] Bran survives, but is crippled and comatose.[76][77] Eddard rides to King's Landing along with his daughters, Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn remains at Winterfell with their sons.

When Robert holds a small council meeting to arrange the death of the exiled Daenerys Targaryen, who has wed Drogo, a mighty khal of the Dothraki, Ned refuses to condone the assassination and resigns as Hand.[82] In the streets of the capital, he is waylaid by Jaime Lannister and red cloaks in retaliation for Catelyn's abduction of Tyrion Lannister, whom her foster-brother, Petyr Baelish, had told her was responsible for the attempt on Bran's life.[83] Ned's leg is broken and his best men slain, but Ned survives and Robert re-confirms his appointment as Hand before going on a hunt and leaving Ned to sit the Iron Throne.[71] In this capacity he sends men, including twenty Stark guards, to stop Ser Gregor Clegane from raiding the riverlands.[84] Gregor's attacks were ordered by Lord Lannister; since Lord Stark was wounded he was not lured into the field and thus could not be captured and traded for Tyrion.

He approaches Cersei with this truth, warning her to flee the city.[89] Enlisting Lord Baelish to recruit the gold cloaks,[90] Ned confronts Cersei after Robert's death from a hunting accident, insisting that Stannis Baratheon is now king by rights. Littlefinger betrays Ned, however, and the Hand's men are slaughtered by Janos Slynt's gold cloaks and Ned is thrown into a black cell.[91] Sansa is held hostage in the Red Keep,[92] but Arya manages to escape thanks to Syrio Forel, the fencing master Ned had hired to train her in swordplay.[18]Robb Stark, upon hearing this news, calls the banners of Winterfell and marches south to rescue his father and sisters.[22] Catelyn arranges an alliance with Lord Walder Frey to negotiate a crossing of the Green Fork, promising that Robb and Arya will wed Freys.[93] Robb captures Jaime in the Whispering Wood[94] and then relieves the Lannisters' siege of Riverrun with the Battle of the Camps.[95] The rest of the Stark army, led by Lord Roose Bolton, is defeated by Tywin in the battle on the Green Fork, however.[96]Ned initially refuses to name Joffrey as the true king, but in the end agrees in order to ensure the safety of Sansa.[61] When he publicly announces this support at the Great Sept of Baelor, however, the capricious boy king orders Ned's execution rather than allow him to join the Night's Watch as planned.[97] In response, the northern and river lords at Robb's war council in Riverrun proclaim him King in the North, seceding from the realm of the Iron Throne.[98]Benjen has gone missing beyond the Wall, and Jon Snow, after briefly deserting the Watch to join his half-brother's army, rides as part of the great ranging meant to determine his fate and the threats of the Others and wildlings.",
